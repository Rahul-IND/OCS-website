OCS-Contact Line Website
Last Updated: 01-09-2023
Developed by: Rahul Das [Summer Intern]
Contact Email: rahuldasjec.cse@gmail.com
Internship Duration: July 3, 2023 to September 1, 2023
Guided by: Bhagwat Sharma, Suneel
Technologies used: HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, javascript (Some code has been taken from ChatGPT)

The website's codebase could have been more efficient if other technologies were used
However, due to limited resources & to make it easily modifiable by people from non-CS background, the above technologies seemed to be the best option.

# The website is made mainly for following purposes-
1. To present Team details like delivered projects, team's expertise etc. [EXTERNAL USAGE]
2. To use it in team meetings instead of ppts showing team productivity, project history etc. [INTERNAL USAGE]
3. To include reference links, resources required while working on a project.

# This file serves the purpose of providing a better understanding of the file structure and code.

There are six folders viz.
1. documentation -> 
2. fonts -> Contains the file Siemens_Sans_Roman.ttf 
            This font is used in the whole website.
3. icons -> Contains all the icons (as well as logos) used in the website
            Most of them are in svg format
4. images -> Contains all the images used throughout the website
5. javascripts -> This folder contains all the JavaScript files. 
                    Each JavaScript file is dedicated to a specific component. 
                    Whenever a component is used on a webpage, the corresponding JavaScript file is imported to provide its functionality.
6. pages -> Contains all the HTML files


CSS files-
1. input.css -> This file is used to write custom CSS as per developer's need
2. output.css -> This is the final compiled CSS file that includes both custom styles and the generated utility classes from Tailwind CSS. This file is linked to in HTML files to apply the styles to elements.

JS file -
1. tailwind.config.js -> This is a configuration file used to customize and control various aspects of the framework's (Tailwind's) behavior. This file allows to fine-tune settings, add new utility classes, configure colors, typography, spacing, and more.


README.md -> Acts as a guide to create shortcut
